# Predictive Model for Stolen Base Success

## Introduction

This project was conducted in collaboration with the Twins Diversity Education Project, where the objective was to analyze the factors that contribute to stolen base success in baseball. My specific role within the project was to develop a predictive model to understand which factors influence the likelihood of a successful stolen base attempt.

## Methodology

To achieve this goal, I implemented a linear regression model using the R programming language. This model helped us decipher the key factors that contribute to stolen base success in baseball. While the specific details of the model and dataset cannot be publicly shared due to privacy concerns of the organization, this GitHub repository serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in using R and showcases my work as a part of my baseball analytics portfolio.
